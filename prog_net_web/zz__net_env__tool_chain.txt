Common Network Configuration Files and Tools
====================
Configuration Tool   Primary File(s)                          Typical Use Case
ifupdown             /etc/network/interfaces                  Simple server config, or minimal installs without a desktop environment
NetworkManager       /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* Default for most desktop installations (e.g., GNOME, KDE)
systemd-networkd     /etc/systemd/network/*                   Modern, non-GUI configuration method using systemd's networking daemon
Netplan              /etc/netplan/*.yaml                      Acts as a front-end for either NetworkManager or systemd-networkd

Configuration Tool   Service
ifupdown             systemctl status networking.service
NetworkManager       systemctl status NetworkManager.service
systemd-networkd     systemctl status systemd-networkd.service

Ubuntu with gnome
 default: Netplan => Network Manager => ADSL => Internet
 olders:  the same as Debian default

Debian with gnome
 default: /etc/network/interfaces => Network Manager => ADSL => Internet

Raspberry OS
 default: /etc/dhcpcd.conf => dhcpcd => ADSL => Internet
 alter:   /etc/network/interfaces => Network Manager => ADSL => Internet

Ubuntu server on Raspberry
 default: Netplan => systemd-networkd => ADSL => Internet

Arch Linux
 /etc/netctl/conf_files => netctl => ADSL => Internet

Others
 /etc/network/interfaces => systemd-networkd => ADSL => Internet
